          <h3>History of watches</h3>
          <p>
            Step back in history of watches; the arrow of time waits for no one.
            Portable spring-driven clocks were invented in the 15th century, the
            very first watch was produced in Nuremberg, Germany, by Peter
            Henlein. His spring-loaded design had a dial that was about 75mm, so
            it was much more suited to be worn on a pendant or attached to a
            belt. But it was a portable timepiece, and that's why Henlein is
            widely regarded as the father of modern watches.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Evolution of watch technology</h3>
          <p>
            Today's people are looking forward to wearable technology such as
            Pebbles and Google glasses, the watch was actually the original
            wearable technology. Modern watches are masterfully crafted by
            engineers, horologists, and designers. The portable timepiece was
            the clock watch which were designed to be worn around the neck and
            were largely ornamental. Still, they were, and are, beautiful and
            made for unique pendants and also Pocket watches became popular
            along with the waistcoat in the 17th century. Meanwhile,
            smartwatches are transforming the industry by integrating features
            like health monitoring, GPS, and connectivity . Whether we
            appreciate the timeless elegance of mechanical movements or the
            versatility of contemporary watches, the world of horology offers
            something extraordinary for everyone.

                    Poor circulation: If the watchband is very tight, it could
                    potentially cut off blood circulation to the wrist and give
                    rise to other circulation problems.

                    Radiation exposure: Smart feature watches, just like

                    radiation, which, though within known safe limits.

                    Overdependence on time: The person who always looks at the
                    time is less connected with the moment and may become
                    somewhat oblivious to being present and investing in what is
                    currently happening.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            From the convenience of time-keeping to their application as a tool
            for personal expression to their very specialized application in
            sports and diving, timepieces indeed are timeless accessories. Apart
            from the status they bring, they may have sentimental value;
            nevertheless, watches have negative effects on the environment,
            stress levels, and dependency on technology excessively. Watches
            would remain truly treasured accessories which make constant
            readjustments to person's needs and lifestyle by balancing the
            advantages with considerate use.
